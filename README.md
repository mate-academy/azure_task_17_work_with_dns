# Work with DNS

One of your application's first clients is a company called `ornottodo`. They want to deploy your to-do app into their internal network (which is currently in Azure). The challenge here is that `ornottodo` folks want to have it available by domain name rather than internal IP. 

In this task, you will have to learn how to work with DNS in Azure.  

## Prerequisites

Before completing any task in the module, make sure that you followed all the steps described in the **Environment Setup** topic, in particular: 

1. Ensure you have an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) account and subscription.

2. Create a resource group called *“mate-resources”* in the Azure subscription.

3. In the *“mate-resources”* resource group, create a storage account (any name) and a *“task-artifacts”* container.

4. Install [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4) on your computer. All tasks in this module use PowerShell 7. To run it in the terminal, execute the following command: 
    ```
    pwsh
    ```

5. Install [Azure module for PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?view=azps-11.3.0): 
    ```
    Install-Module -Name Az -Repository PSGallery -Force
    ```
If you are a Windows user, before running this command, please also run the following: 
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

6. Log in to your Azure account using PowerShell:
    ```
    Connect-AzAccount -TenantId <your Microsoft Entra ID tenant id>
    ```

## Requirements

In this task, you will need to update the existing PowerShell script `task.ps1`. The original script deploys 2 virtual machines: 

- `webserver`, used to host the todo web app. It's deployed in a subnet `web`, without public IP.
- `jumpbox`, used as a dedicated virtual machine for management of `webserver`. It is deployed to a separate subnet, has a public IP, and allows connecting to it through SSH.  

In this task, you need to deploy a private DNS zone `todo.or.nottodo` and create a DNS record in it: 

1. Review the script `task.ps1`.  

2. Add deployment of private DNS zone `or.nottodo`. To deploy a private DNS zone, use comandlet [New-AzPrivateDnsZone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.privatedns/new-azprivatednszone?view=azps-12.0.0). 

3. Don't forget to add linking of the newly-created DNS zone to the virtual network, where VMs are deployed. You can do it with comandlet [New-AzPrivateDnsVirtualNetworkLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.privatedns/new-azprivatednsvirtualnetworklink?view=azps-12.0.0). Make sure to enable [auto-registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-autoregistration) feature when creating a link. 

4. Add creating of a `CNAME` record in the private DNS zone — use comandlet [New-AzPrivateDnsRecordSet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.privatedns/new-azprivatednsrecordset?view=azps-12.0.0). `CNAME` should point domain `todo.or.nottodo` to the domain, `webserver` virtual machine will get with auto-registration in the private DNS zone. 

5. When the script is ready, run it to deploy resources to your subscription.

6. To test yourself, connect to the `jumbox` VM with SSH, and test with curl, if you can get to the todo web app by its domain name `todo.or.nottodo` (app will be running on `port 8080`, so you will need to use the following URL for curl: `http://todo.or.nottodo:8080/`). 

7. Run artifacts generation script `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1`.

8. Test yourself using the script `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1`.

9. Make sure that changes to both `task.ps1` and `result.json` are committed to the repo, and submit the solution for review. 

10. When the solution is validated, delete the resources you deployed with the PowerShell script — you won't need them for the next tasks. 


## How to Complete Tasks in This Module 

Tasks in this module are relying on 2 PowerShell scripts: 

- `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` generates the task “artifacts” and uploads them to cloud storage. An “artifact” is evidence of a task completed by you. Each task will have its own script, which will gather the required artifacts. The script also adds a link to the generated artifact in the `artifacts.json` file in this repository — make sure to commit changes to this file after you run the script. 
- `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1` validates the artifacts generated by the first script. It loads information about the task artifacts from the `artifacts.json` file.

Here is how to complete tasks in this module:

1. Clone task repository;

2. Make sure you completed the steps, described in the Prerequisites section;

3. Complete the task described in the Requirements section;

4. Run `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` to generate task artifacts. The script will update the file `artifacts.json` in this repo;

5. Run `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1` to test yourself. If tests are failing — follow the recommendations from the test script error message to fix or re-deploy your infrastructure. When you are ready to test yourself again — **re-generate the artifacts** (step 4) and re-run tests again; 

6. When all tests will pass — commit your changes and submit the solution for review. 

Pro tip: if you are stuck with any of the implementation steps, run `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` and `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1`. The validation script might give you a hint on what to do.  

## Results of the initial task code review:

1. Code was refactored for better readability
2. URLs in the Install script and in Powershell code were amended to properly refer to my updated code
3. VM deployment process was reworked through the `New-AzVMConfig` + `...` + `New-AzVM` form in order to:

    * set proper OS disk size to meet the "Free services for 12 months" limitations
    * set custom names, instead of random generic ones for:

      * OS disks
      * Network Interface Configurations
      * IP Configs
      * Boot Diagnostic Storage Account

## The Task's Scope Solution:

1. Private DNS Zone was created with `New-AzPrivateDnsZone`
2. Both deployed VMs had private subdomain DNS auto-assigned using `New-AzPrivateDnsVirtualNetworkLink`
3. Web VM subdomain was reassigned to `DesiredSubdomain` "**todo**" using `New-AzPrivateDnsRecordSet`
    where:

    * Name refers to desired subdomain
    * PrivateDnsRecords's record is constructed as `oldSubdomainName`.`privateDnsZoneName`
